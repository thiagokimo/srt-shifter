How many times you downloaded a movie that you couldn't find a perfect synchronized subtitle to watch it?

SRT Shifter is an open-source command-line tool that fixes the timming of your SubRip files!

##Pre-requisites

Install [Ruby Gems](https://rubygems.org/ "Ruby Gems") package manager installed in your system 

##Instalation

To install, just type:

    $ gem install srtshifter

## Usage

On the command-line, type the command below to get more information.

    $ srtshifter --help

This example generates a new srt file called new_sub.srt, with 2.5 milliseconds shifted ahead 
from original_sub.srt file.

    $ strshifter -o ADD -t 2.5 original_sub.srt new_sub.srt

This example moves all subtitle times where the new subtitles start at 1 minute and 36 seconds and end at 1 hour, 36 minutes and 54 seconds. It moves all subtitles proportionally!

    $ strshifter -o SYNC -b 00:01:36 -e 01:36:54 original_sub.srt new_sub.srt
    
## Future ideas and "to do"s'

1. Create a self-instalation script
2. Add more operations flexible operations (i.e: Edit specific part of the file)
